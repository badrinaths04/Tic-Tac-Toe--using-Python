# Tic-Tac-Toe--using-Python

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python.

## Features

- Two players take turns to mark an empty cell in a 3x3 grid.
- The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- The game ends in a tie if there are no more empty cells and no winner.
